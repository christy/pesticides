FOIA RAW DATA DATES NOTES: 
min date = 2017-01-11 00:00:00
max date = 2019-08-23 00:00:00
2018    903
2019    880
2017     16

Question 1) Why are there so many fewer entries in 2019 than in 2018?  Why don't 2019 dates go past Aug2019?  
Question 2) Why did FOIA 2018-2019 bring up 2017 dates?
Question 3) Is it possible that CDPR "2019" is a growing season 2019 possibly?

I didn't get any answers so I assumed "FOIA request reporting years" as follows:
   FOIA CDPR 2019 = calendar dates Sep2018 - Aug2019 
   FOIA CDPR 2018 = calendar dates Sep2017 - Aug2018 

Revised data counts using "FOIA reporting years" assumption below, seems to make more sense:
2019    927
2018    872
